# pytglue
Python Wrapper for IT Glue

This is still in the very early stages of development, and has not been fully tested. 

Right now it can only perform GET requests for Configurations, Flexible Assets, Organizations, and Contacts. 
Once I sort out Create and Update I will shift focus to documentation. 

I have very little experience in coding, so please excuse the poor quality and any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated.
